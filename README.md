# Predictive-Model-Logistic-Regression-for-Binary-Classification

# Description:
### More often than not, resources are scarce for businesses. It is essential to have the meaningful information to make the right decision and craft an effective strategy. Having a deeper understanding of the data can benefit businesses for informed decision-making. In this dataset "advertising", the business is trying to understand the customers' behaviors - if the customer would click on the online advertisement during their internet usage. The machine learning logistic regression model will be used to answer this binary classification question.


# Project Objective:
### To develop a machine learning using the logistic regression model to predict if the customer "Clicked on Ad".


# Process:
### This interesting project will start off with basic descriptive analysis, followed by detailed exploratory data analysis, data visualization of the features, data cleansing, and scaling the data to prepare for machine learning model from sklearn library. The model will be evaluated using classification report and confusion matrix, which are the standard evaluation metrics for binary classification model.


# Positive Impact:
### The business will gain actionable insights to their question by predicting the customer's behavior. Upon success, the business can craft a more effective strategy to boost their advertisement exposure on the website. Having a deeper understanding of the data using advanced data analysis can help businesses make the best available decision and deploy an effective business strategies.
